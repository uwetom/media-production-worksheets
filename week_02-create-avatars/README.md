# Creating Avatars with Generative AI

In this worksheet we're going to generate a 3D Avatar using generative AI.

## 1. Remove background
In this example I have made an Avatar of myself from a single still photo of me in T pose.

I'm using https://studio.tripo3d.ai/   but you could also try https://www.meshy.ai/    

First of all I'm going to clean up the photograph and remove the background using Adobe Express.

## 2. Generate Avatar
Now I'm going to use the downloaded cleaned image to generate a 3D avatar.   

Create an account https://studio.tripo3d.ai/ to get free credits.

Select Generation and Build and refine.

Upload the photo and add a text prompt.

Now I'm ready to rig the avatar.
