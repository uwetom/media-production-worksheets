# 3D scanning

For this worksheet we will be using phones and tablets to 3D scan objects and people into a 3D meshes. Will then clean up these meshes to use in our projects.

# 1. Reality Scan

To scan objects we will use [Reality scan](https://www.realityscan.com/en-US) from Epic games who make the Unreal Game Engine.

Reality scan uses photogrammetry to create a 3D model from pictures of an object. 

## Download the app

You can find the app on the android of Apple store

[https://www.realityscan.com/en-US/mobile](https://www.realityscan.com/en-US/mobile)

You can or even use a web based version where you can upload images.

## Principles of Photogrammetry 

Before we scan anything we need consider how photogrammetry works so that we can get the best quality scan.

### 1. Image Quality

Each image needs to be sharp, not blurry or noisy
	- Move the camera slowly
	- Ensure there is plenty of light.
	
### 2. Subject Coverage

The entire object needs to be captured, take photos above and bellow the object and circle it to at multiple heights to capture all the details.

### 3. Information Overlap

Each image should overlap with another so that common reference points on each photo can be used to stitch together the whole object.

## Environment

We also need to make sure the environment is consistent through out the scan to ensure the images all match

- If you are outside, choose a grey day to avoid harsh shadows or the light levels changing during the scan
- no wind, the object or background should not move during the scan.

# 2. Scan an object

Some objects are more suitable then other and will give better results

Avoid objects which are:
- Transparent
- Shiney
- Plain

Organic objects with texture and detail work best.


- Find a suitable small object to scan
- Place it somewhere you can access every side to get the best angle.
- Open the app and press the plus symbol to create a new scan.

# 3. Export the scan
