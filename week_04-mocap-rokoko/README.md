# Motion capture with Rokoko

We will be using a Rokoko Smart suit 2 with their Rokoko studio software to capture our motion tracking data.

The Rokoko Smart suit uses inertial sensors (IMU's) to capture the movement of the suit without external cameras.
The IMU's are connected to a hub on the back of the suit which then transmit the data wirelessly to a computer.

To ensure the connection is fast and consistent we are using a router to create a local wireless network.

## 1. Rokoko studio

The Smart suit works with Rokoko Studio to record the motion data.

We will be using the free version on a PC in the lab.

## 2. Smart Suit

We will be using the Rokoko Smart suite 2

You put the suit on just like a normal boiler suit, with the zip at the front. Be careful not to step on the sensors.

### Tips to get a good recording

 - Have a clear plan before you start to avoid having to have muliple sessions to capture all the data you need.
 - Recalibrate the suit between takes
 - Keep clips to under a minute to reduce sensor drift.

## 4. Clean up

Now that we have our footage we may need to clean it up to improve the tracking quality.
