# Motion capture with Rokoko

We will be using a Rokoki Smart suit 2 with their Rokoko studio software to capture our motion tracking data.

The Rokoko Smart suit uses inertial sensors (IMU's) to capture the movement of the suit without external cameras.
The IMU's are connected to a hub on the back of the suit which then transmit the data wirelessly to a computer.

To ensure the connection is fast and consistent we are using a router to create a local wireless network.

## 1. Rokoko studio

The Smart suit works with Rokoko Studio to record the motion data.

We will be using the free version on a PC in the lab. 

You can download it yourself here:

## 2. Smart Suit

We will be using the Rokoko Smart suite 2 with smart gloves. This allows us to track the full body and hands, but not the face.

You put the suit on just like a normal boiler suit, with the zip at the front. Be careful not to step on the sensors.

One the suit is on you can put on and plug in the gloves.

## 3. Record some data

Now you have to suit on and connected to the software we can capture some motion.

### Tips for good tracing

 - Have a clear plan before you start to avoid having to have muliple sessions to capture all the data you need.
 - Recalibrate the suit between takes
 - Keep clips to under a minute to reduce sensor drift.

## 4. Clean up

Now that we have our footage we may need to clean it up to impove the tracking quality.

## 5. Export

- You can now export your clips as fbx files for use in Maya or Unity


### Extras

There are lots of video on the Rokoko you tube site you can use to impove your motion capture
