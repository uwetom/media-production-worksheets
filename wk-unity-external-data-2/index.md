*(AR scene of Near Earth Objects designated as hazardous by NASA, generated from a NASA dataset)*

## Overview
In this next tutorial we are going to use  data to add objects and information to an AR scene (preview above)..

This follows on directly from **Using external data in unity pt 1** So you should have completed pt 1 and have your your Unity project open and your **GetData** C# script open in Visual Studio to begin.

It is possible to use incoming data to alter nearly every aspect of your your scene by using the data to interact with the components in your Game Objects (objects, atmosphere, materials, texture, physics and so on). 

In this example we are going to use the data instantiate (create) objects in our scene.

## Set up: install rock package

Download [this](https://github.com/uwetom/media-production-worksheets/raw/refs/heads/master/wk-unity-external-data-2/Asteroids.unitypackage) unity package of rock prefabs and animations.
Drag it into your Assets folder to install it.
