# Motion capture with Rokoko

## Smart Suit

We will be using the Rokoko Smart suite 2 with smart gloves. This allows us to track the full body and hands, but not the face. It is an inertial suit.

You put the suit on just like a normal boiler suit, with the zip at the front. Be careful not to step on the sensors.

One the suit is on you can put on and plug in the gloves.

Open Rokoko studio and create a new project and scene
