# Animating with MoCap data 

To start using MoCap data you'll need a new project set up and have downloaded a Mixamo character with an animation attached from https://www.mixamo.com/

This is a free website with 1000s of animations amd 100s of characters that you can download and use in your project.

You'll also need to import your motion capture data / .fbx file into your Unity project. Make an Animations folder for everything. I've imported two call tom-001 and tom-002.

Now there are several steps that you need to follow to use your mocap data in animation in the :
Set up the character

Next we'll set up our character in the scene with the animation and skin that you downloaded.

Change your Unity scene name to 'Main'. Add a cube in the scene and scale it to make a ground plane.
