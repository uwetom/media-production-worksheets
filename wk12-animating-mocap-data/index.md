# Animating with MoCap data 

To start using MoCap data you'll need a new project set up and have downloaded a Mixamo character with an animation attached from https://www.mixamo.com/

This is a free website with 1000s of animations amd 100s of characters that you can download and use in your project.

You'll also need to import your motion capture data / .fbx file into your Unity project. Make an Animations folder for everything.
