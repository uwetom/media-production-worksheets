*(AR scene of Near Earth Objects designated as hazardous by NASA, generated from a NASA dataset)*

## Overview
In this session we are going to learn how to import live, external data (in JSON format) in Unity and extract  some data from the imported JSON.  

Then in the next worksheet we will use the data to add objects and information to an AR scene (preview above)..

Most of this worksheet will involve working with a C# script and the Unity3D console. We are going to use the NASA data for Near Earth Objects that we looked at previously https://api.nasa.gov/.

We are also going to use an external C# code library for Unity called [SimpleJSON](https://github.com/Bunny83/SimpleJSON) to help us.
