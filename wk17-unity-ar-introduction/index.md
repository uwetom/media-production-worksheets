# Introduction to Augmented Reality (AR) in Unity

First we want to create a new Unity project, helpfully, Unity hub has a template which includes all the recommended packages and settings so we can get started quickly.

- Create a new Unity project using the AR Core template, you may need to download it first.

Once the project is open we will get a helpful box telling us to set the planforms we wish to deploy to.
