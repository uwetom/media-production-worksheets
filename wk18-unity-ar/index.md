## More Unity AR - Planes and faces


## Template

At the start of the last worksheet you created a template AR project.

I have created a GitHub repository with this template project which you can **fork** and **clone**

[https://github.com/uwetom/unity_ar_template](https://github.com/uwetom/unity_ar_template)

Once opened in Unity you may need switch the build target to Android.

- In the top menu, go to **File > Build Settings**
- Switch the platform to **Android**
