## More Unity AR - Interactions

In this worksheet we will look at adding interactions in our AR project.

## Starting project

This worksheet continues on from last weeks marker tracking project. 

If you have a finished working version of this project open that and skip to **Duplicate Scene** 

If you do not have a completed marker tracking project you can fork and clone my template project from github.

[Github repository](https://github.com/uwetom/Unity-Worksheet-1-finished)

![fork button on github.com](https://github.com/uwetom/media-production-worksheets/blob/master/wk18-unity-ar/images/fork.jpg?raw=true)

The following video will show you how to do this if you are unsure.


-------------CLONE and fork video ------------------------


## Duplicate Scene

In the **Scenes** folder, duplicate and rename your tracked image scene (it should be called **AR_tracked_image** ) and name it "AR_Interaction".

## Test the new scene

Open your new scene and press play to test it, you should see a ship appear on your marker in the virtual environment.

You will also want to test that the correct build platform is selected, 

- In the top menu, go to **File > Build Settings** and check that the current Platform is Android ( if not switch to it)

## XR Interaction toolkit

We want to interact with the objects in our scene by touching the screen.

We could manually setup and program the inputs ourselves but helpfully Unity has made an interaction toolkit package which contains everything we need.

We will be using it for AR, but as the name suggests, the XR toolkit also also works with VR projects and we will use it again later in the course.

- go to **Windows > Package Manager**
- In Unity Registry, search for "XR"
- Install the **XR Interaction Toolkit**

![turn on XR Simulation](https://github.com/uwetom/media-production-worksheets/blob/master/wk18-unity-ar/images/interaction_toolkit.jpg?raw=true)

As XR technology is rapidly evolving, Unity frequently updates this package with major changes. We will be using version 2.5 as it is the latest stable release for Unity 2023.

WARNING: Tutorials you find online may be using other versions of Unity and the toolkit which may not be compatible with what is covered in this worksheet

If in doubt, as always, check the documentation:

[XR Interaction toolkit 2.5](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@2.5/manual/index.html)

We will also add the starter assets samples which will give us some assets.

- In the **XR Interation Toolkit** open the **Samples** tab and import the **Starter Assets**

## Interaction Toolkit Components

There are three main **components** we need to add to our scene when using the toolkit for AR.

1. Interactables
	- These are added to individual objects in our scene, marking them as interactable so they can be selected and manipulated by the user.
2. Interactor
	- This is placed on the camera or controller which will select the interactables.
3. Interaction manager - This Contects the interactables to the interactors.

### 1. Interactable

We just want to be able to select our object, so we just need a simple interactable, 

- In the ship folder, double click to open the ship prefab.
- go into the **Ship-large** object
- Add an **XR Simple Interactable** component to it.

The object will also need a collider, we don't need it to match the shape of the ship so will just use a box.

- Add a **Box Collider** component 

![toolkit samples](https://github.com/uwetom/media-production-worksheets/blob/master/wk18-unity-ar/images/ship_collider.jpg?raw=true)

You can now save and go back to the scene

### 2. Interactor

We want to select our object by touching the screen on our device. Do do this we need to setup 2 things

1. specify user interactions, this needs to register clicks in the simulated environment and touches on the phone.
2. link those interactions to actions in unity
2. when the action is triggered send out a ray from where the user touches and check if it hits an object




----------------- interactor video ----------------




Add an input Action Manager component XR origin
	add an action asset
	add default input actions ( uses new input system)
	
Add raycast manager

make a new object next to the main camera and call it "interactor"
	add an xr ray interactor - tick enable ar raycasting
	add a screen space controller
		add tap start and drag current touch gestures
		
		
-----------
	
### 3. Interaction Manager

We can now add our manager

- In the scene hierachy, **right click** and select **XR > XR Interaction Manager**

![toolkit samples](https://github.com/uwetom/media-production-worksheets/blob/master/wk18-unity-ar/images/interaction_manger.jpg?raw=true)

### 

We now have everything set up, you can now select the object by clicking on it.  But, we can't test it yet as we haven't told Unity to do anything when the object is selected.

We will make a script with a function that we can call when the object is selected.

#### Challenge

Make a new script with a **public** function which shows a simple message on the console when called.

<details>
<summary>HINT</summary>
Debug.Log("my message");
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
- Create a new script in the script folder by right clicking and selecting **create > c# Script**
- Delete the update and start methods
- Create a new public function logging out a message

```
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class Interactions : MonoBehaviour
{
   public void selected()
   {
        Debug.Log("ship selected");
   }
}
```
</details>

### Add the script to your object	

We can now add this script to our Object

- Open your Ship prefab
- Open the Ship-large object
- Drag your new script on the object. ( you may need to lock the inspector panel in the top right)

### Connect the interactor to the script


----------connect the interactor to the script video --------------------

- Go into the simple interactable component and go into interactable events
- Press plus on the Select Entered section
- drag the main controller onto it
- choose the interaction.selected function


---------------

You can now press play and test your scene in the simulated environment, the ship should appear on the marker image, and when you click on it you should get a message in your console.


Now that we have a script hooked up to the interaction we fire off any other code we want, we could play a sound, instantiate another object, play an animation, all three or anything else we can think of.

#### Annotation

We will add some annotations to the ship which appear when its touched.

-----------create ui video---------------------


- create new empty game object in ship and call it annotation
- add a text mesh-pro - text component ( install tmp)
- add any other things you want 

alter the script


```
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class Interactions : MonoBehaviour
{

    bool annotationVisible = false;
    public GameObject annotation;

    public void selected()
    {

        Debug.Log("show annotation");
        if (annotationVisible)
        {
            annotation.SetActive(false);
            annotationVisible = false;
        }else {
            annotation.SetActive(true);
            annotationVisible = true;
        }

    }
}
```
